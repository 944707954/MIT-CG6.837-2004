2.sphere.cpp中 flag=true的位置影响shadows中 epsilon的作用

3.
The -shade_back command line option should be used when there are transparent objects in the scene.
The dot product of the normal and ray direction is negative when we are outside the object, 
and positive when we are inside. 
You will use this to detect whether the new index of refraction is 1 or 
the index of the hit object ?? why not 1/index

4.
Note that in this naive version, semi-transparent objects still cast opaque shadows. 
Implement something better for extra credit.  未实现


5. gem 有点区别
